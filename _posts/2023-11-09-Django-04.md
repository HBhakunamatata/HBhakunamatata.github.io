## 1.1 Signal

- Signal: A way of listening to actions(events) that performs in our application

![image about signal process](/assets/post-images/django-complete-course/signal-process-pattern.drawio.png)

1. create signals.py and register


```python
# create signals.py and register it in app.py
class UsersConfig(AppConfig):
    default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
    name = 'users'

    def ready(self):
        import users.signals
```

2. import signals and define actions


```python
from django.db.models.signals import post_save, post_delete
from django.dispatch import receiver
from .models import Profile
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

def on_user_created(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    """只当新User被创建时,自动添加Profile"""
    print('user created signal received!')
    if created:
        Profile.objects.create(
            user = instance,
            username = instance.username,
            email = instance.email,
        )
```

3. join receivers and action with signals


```python
post_save.connect(on_user_created, sender=User)
```

## 1.2 Flash Messages

```python
# 1. import messages
from django.contrib import messages

# 2. send messages
messages.info(request, "xxx")
```
